# tgtg_orderchecker
this is a small Tkinter app that i made that will check your orders on PC, as there is no app for PC yet

if you dont already have your API key && other stuff, run the getapi file and the output of that will go into your key.py file
  why did i make this like that?
  - To make it safe and not to accidentally push to github!

THIS IS something i made with THE [TGTG-PYTHON](https://github.com/ahivert/tgtg-python) LIBRARY API THING
